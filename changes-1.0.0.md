# Change Log 1.0.0
### The TechnoVision TurtyWurty Remix

[Release Page](https://github.com/jackokring/ExactFeather396/releases)

* Fixed basic faults with 1.18.1 changes in the symbol set.
* Removed Ore generation as 1.18.1 has `data` tags for doing this kind of thing like generating biomes. I assume this is to stop failure of vanilla biomes by block pollution. A biome maybe added later to test this idea.
* Internal `ForgeSpawnEggItem` automation.
* Class refactoring.
* Removed `oven` so need new container start.
* Added `RegistryMap` for index hashing.

### TODO

* Created workarounds when current code not possible.
* Fixed the `hog` to the latest code examples.
