The Book of Mundane Things

Once upon a time in the overworld the potion mechanism was cast to bring @item.minecraft.potion.effect.mundane to mean so much and confusion was born of the alchemical waste. The magic was strong though and sorting out some lesser mundane was just a labelling exercise. And so the following became available:

@item.minecraft.potion.effect.sugar

@item.minecraft.potion.effect.magma_cream

@item.minecraft.potion.effect.rabbit_foot

@item.minecraft.potion.effect.glistering_melon_slice

@item.minecraft.potion.effect.blaze_powder

@item.minecraft.potion.effect.ghast_tear

@item.minecraft.potion.effect.spider_eye

There were also the modern future mundanes discovered by careful experiment with the @item.minecraft.potion.effect.awkward and the finding that @item.minecraft.potion.effect.thick could be a drink for some, although not all as for others it was poison. These were as follows:

@item.minecraft.potion.effect.golden_carrot

@item.minecraft.potion.effect.turtle_helmet

@item.minecraft.potion.effect.pufferfish

@item.minecraft.potion.effect.phantom_membrane

And it became possible to experiment with the potions as ingredients in more than just brewing. To find the essences and things within the scope of this great reality.
