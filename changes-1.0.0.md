[Release Page](https://github.com/jackokring/ExactFeather396/releases)

* Fixed basic faults with 1.18.1 changes in the symbol set.
* Created workarounds when not possible.
* Removed Ore generation as 1.18.1 has `data` tags for doing this kind of thing like generating biomes.
* Fixed the `Animal` to the latest code examples.
* Internal `Forge Spawn Egg` automation.
